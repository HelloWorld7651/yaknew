## To Run

2a 
Platform:MAC
To Run:
1. MAKE
2. ./server
    In a new Tab run, ./client
    exit exits the client
    ./client for each new client you want to open. Server stays up no matter what
Clean the game:
1. make clean

I believe networkmanager.h, input.cpp and .h, client.cpp(Formally chat.cpp), NameEntry.cpp and .h, Sentry.h, EventNetwork.h
are all provided by the professor.

Everything else was code added

Important: I also don't know if windows compatability was added. I only really tested it on mac because I am on mac.I know it works for my mac. I also believe my solution on works on local, because I was under the impression we only really need to do local
